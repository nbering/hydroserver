## What is this?

A simple tool for interacting with the [CUAHSI](https://github.com/CUAHSI) WaterOneFlow
Web Service included in their HydroServer project. I specifically build this to
fetch data from the HydroServer run by the [Niagara Peninsula Conversation Authority](npca.ca).

## Is it finished?

Not even close. At this point the tool is just a proof of concept. I'll be working
a little more on it to make it more functional and add documentation.

## Contributing

The project's a bit of a mess right now but I welcome issues for feature suggestions,
use case descriptions, bug reports, or support requests.

Pull Requests may or may not be accepted depending on content. Please ask first
before writing significant amounts of code so that I can give some guidance based
on my plans for the project. Thank you!
